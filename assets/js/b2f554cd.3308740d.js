Recently I\'ve felt a need to start creating content. Or, more like get back into doing it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last time I had a blog was more than 15 years ago. As a teenager, I used to run the \\"My IT News\\" WordPress site with, as you may expect, news around IT - especially the new consumer electronics products. While it didn\'t have much attention (as far as I remember, around ~5k unique visitors per month), I enjoyed doing it. But I had plenty of time and energy back then. Today I\'m struggling with both, so... I\'m starting a new blog! That makes sense, right?\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n### Why yet another blog\\r\\n\\r\\nNowadays, everyone has their own blog. Do I really need to become another wannabe influencer?\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. What I want to achieve is:\\r\\n\\r\\n- structure my knowledge and record what I\'ve learned recently,\\r\\n- try out new ways to increase productivity, stay motivated and avoid burnout,\\r\\n- improve my English (as a non-native English speaker),\\r\\n- develop self-discipline, reduce procrastination, and, as a result, save time to do the things mentioned above.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, as you can see, it\'s mostly for me, but I hope you\'ll benefit from this as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n### What to expect\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, definitely shorter, more concise blog posts, like this one.\\r\\n\\r\\n<center>\\r\\n\\r\\n![Ain\'t nobody got time for that](./assets/aint-nobody-got-time-for-that.gif) <br/><small>source: <a href=\\"https://tenor.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">tenor.com</a></small>\\r\\n\\r\\n</center>\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I have a few ideas for new blog posts in mind, I don\'t want to limit myself to just technical topics. Instead, I will probably touch on different areas of my interest, such as:\\r\\n\\r\\n- full-stack technical topics related to the technologies I use (Go, Kubernetes, React.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, GraphQL, gRPC...),\\r\\n- personal projects announcements,\\r\\n- new talks announcements\\r\\n- open source,\\r\\n- cool projects and apps I stumbled upon,\\r\\n- productivity,\\r\\n- personal growth (i.e. soft skills),\\r\\n- finance.\\r\\n\\r\\nYup, that\'s a lot - but we\'ll see how it goes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt some point, I would also like to experiment with the form of the content. Videos, podcasts? Maybe one day...\\r\\n\\r\\n### Closing words\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note that my previous blog posts published on different platforms won\'t be moved. There are just very few of them, though. To read them, see my profiles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@pkosiec) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/pkosiec).\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you got to this point, then congratulations.
